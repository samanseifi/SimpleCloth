# SimpleCloth
This is a casual implementation of mass-spring system for simulating cloth in C++. 

The mass-spring system is based on Provot's model. The simpleset physical cloth model is to consider the sheet of cloth and divide it up into series of evenly spaced masses. These masses are connected to one another by springs in three different ways: 1) Structural springs, 2) Flexeral springs and 3) Bending springs.
